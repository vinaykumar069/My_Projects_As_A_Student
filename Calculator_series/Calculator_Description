Calculator.py is a small project idea that sparked in a moment, everyone just does a simple calculator that takes 2 or 3 inputs and does an operation with them.
I wanted to let the user enter a mathematical statement consisting of a sign(+,-,*,/) and the program does it's work to give an appropriate output.
input: 2+3+3+4
output: 12.0
