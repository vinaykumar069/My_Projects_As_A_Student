Calculator.py is a small project idea that sparked in a moment, everyone just does a simple calculator that takes 2 or 3 inputs one by one and does an operation with them.
I wanted to let the user enter a mathematical statement consisting of a sign(+,-,*,/) and the program does it's work to give an appropriate output.
input: 2+3+3+4     2-3-4     5*3*2    5/2/2
output: 12.0        -5.0      30.0     1.25
